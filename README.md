# ImageConversion-GrayScale-Negative
- Program lets the user select multiple image files
- For each image, create a new image that is a grayscale or negative version of the original image
- For each image, saves the grayscale or negative image in a new file with the same filename as the original image, but with the word “gray-” or "inverted-" in front of the filename. 

> For example, if the original file was named lion.png, the new image would be a grayscale image and be named gray-lion.png or inverted-lion.jpg.

#### Example Image Conversions

- [x] ORIGINAL          
- [x] GRAY-SCALED        
- [x] NEGATIVE
